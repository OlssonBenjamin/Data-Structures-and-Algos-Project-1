# Data-Structures-and-Algos-Project-1
Wrote a program that uses a recursive algorithm to calculate the determinant of a matrix.  
The program reads a matrix and calculates and prints the determinant. THe matrix implementation is that of a "sparse" matrix, i.e
only matrix elements that are non-zero are allocated in memory.
